# React Custom Hooks Practice

This project is created to practice and strengthen the understanding of **React Custom Hooks** and clean **component structure** using **Vite**.

The main focus is on extracting reusable logic from components and organizing the code in a scalable and maintainable way.

## Concepts Covered

- Creating custom hooks  
- Reusing logic across multiple components  
- Separation of logic and UI  
- Component composition  
- Clean and simple project structure with Vite + React

## Purpose of This Project

Instead of duplicating the same logic in different components, this project demonstrates how **custom hooks** help in keeping the code:

- Reusable  
- Readable  
- Easy to maintain  
- Better structured

This project is part of continuous practice and revision of React fundamentals.

## Tech Stack

- React  
- Vite
